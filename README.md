# NLP_GRU_Language_Model
We are using the fundamentals of google's trax package to implement any kind of deeplearning model.

## Overview:
- Convert a line of text into a tensor
- Create an iterator to feed data to the model
- Define a GRU model using trax
- Train the model using trax
- Compute the accuracy of the model using the perplexity
- Predict using our own model
